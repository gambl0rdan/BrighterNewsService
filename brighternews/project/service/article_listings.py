gorillas = '''Two gorillas have been photographed posing for a relaxed selfie with the rangers who rescued them as babies.
The image was taken at a gorilla orphanage in Virunga National Park, DR Congo, where the animals were raised after poachers killed their parents.
The park's deputy director told BBC Newsday that they had learned to imitate their carers, who have looked after them since they were found.
The gorillas, he added, think of the rangers as their parents.
Innocent Mburanumwe, deputy director of Virunga, told the BBC that that the gorillas' mothers were both killed in July 2007.
The gorillas were just two and four months old at the time.'''

dogs = '''Before Matt Nelson had millions of online followers and subscribers, he was just a guy who loved dogs; three years later, he has used his love of canine companions to save the lives of dozens of pups.
When Nelson was just a freshman in college, he started a “We Rate Dogs” Twitter account so he could post pictures of cute dogs and rate them on a 10/10 scale.
That being said, Nelson has given every single dog on his channel a 10/10 rating – “because they’re all better than perfect.'''
